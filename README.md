Password Generator Application
Password Generator Application
This is a simple password generator application written in Python. It generates a random password based on the user's desired length and saves the generated password along with the corresponding platform name to a CSV file.

Requirements
Python 3.x
csv module

How to Use
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Enter the name of the platform for which you want to generate a password.
Enter the desired length of the password.
The application will generate a random password and display it on the screen.
The generated password will be saved to a CSV file named pass.csv, along with the corresponding platform name.

Code Explanation
The script first imports the necessary modules:

string: To access sets of ASCII characters used for password generation.
random: To shuffle the characters and create a random password.
writer from csv: To write data to the CSV file.
The passgen function prompts the user to enter the platform name and desired password length.

It creates four sets of characters: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation.

The sets are combined into a single list and shuffled randomly.

A password is generated by selecting the first pass_length characters from the shuffled list.

The generated password is printed on the screen.

The platform name and password are stored in the passdata list.

The passdata list is then appended to the pass.csv file using the writer object.

The passgen function is called to execute the password generation and saving process.

Note: Make sure to have the appropriate write permissions for the directory where the script is executed to save the CSV file successfully.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code as per your requirements.
